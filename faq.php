            <h4>Background:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>The formula used is the same that is used by the <a href="http://www.usga.org/content/usga/home-page/Handicapping/handicap-manual.html#!rule-14367"><strong>USGA.</strong></a></li>
              <li>On <strong>My Golf Score</strong> only 18 hole rounds are used for Handicap calculations. Depending popularity of the site and requests, 9 hole rounds may be added in the future.</li>
              <li>A minimum of <strong>five</strong> rounds is needed before the handicap is calculated.</li>
              <li>After the fith round has been entered, the first handicap will be calculated.</li>
              <li>The handicap will be recalculated after every round entered.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Step 1 - Calculate the Differentials:</h4>
            <strong>Formula: (Score - Course Rating) x 113 / Slope Rating</strong></br>
            For example, let's say your score is 85, the course rating 72.2, the slope 131. The formula would be:</br>
            <strong>(85 - 72.2) x 113 / 131 = 11.04</strong></br>
            The sum of that calculation is called your "handicap differential." This differential is calculated for each round entered (minimum of five, maximum of 20).
            (Note: The number 113 is a constant and represents the slope rating of a golf course of average difficulty.)

            <h4>Step 2: Determine How Many Differentials To Use:</h4>
            <p>Not every differential that results from Step 1 will be used in the next step. If only five rounds are entered, only the lowest of your five differentials will be used in the following step.
              If 20 rounds are entered, only the 10 lowest differentials are used. Use this chart to determine how many differentials to use in your handicap calculation.</p>

              <strong>Number of Differentials Used</strong></br>
              The number of rounds you are reporting for handicap purposes determines the number of differentials used in the USGA handicap calculation, as follows:

                <h4>Step 3: Average Your Differentials:</h4>
                <p>Get an average of the differentials used by adding them together and dividing by the number used
                  (i.e., if five differentials are used, add them up and divide by five).</p>
                  <h4>Step 4: Arriving At Your Handicap Index:</h4>
                  <p>And the final step is to take the number that results from Step 3 and multiply the result by 0.96 (96-percent).
                    Drop all the digits after the tenths (do not round off) and the result is handicap index.</p>
                    <p>Let's give an example using five differentials. Our differentials worked out to (just making up some numbers for this example)
                      11.04, 12.33, 9.87, 14.66 and 10.59. So we add those up, which produces the number 58.49. Since we used five differentials,
                      we divide that number by five, which produces 11.698. And we multiple that number by 0.96, which equals 11.23, and 11.2 is our handicap index. </p>
